# Animation of an Infographic



I was provided with a Static SVG file, and asked to animate it.

The animations consisted of the following:

Working with Illustrator and InkScape to create vector grouping

Adding JQUery to be able to load the SVG on user brower

Use CSS to animate the content of the InfoGraphic

Add animated modal boxes to the infographic

Add hyper links to the infographics

Make it mobile view friendly.
